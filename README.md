# Module-2-Challenge
Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

* The challenge is to create a professional portfolio to use while applying for web development jobs. The portfolio must use advance CSS skills.


# Portfolio Criteria
Below are the criteria found in my portfolio to satisfy a typical hiring manager's needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

    WHEN I load their portfolio

    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

    WHEN I click on the images of the applications

    THEN I am taken to that deployed application

    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


    The following is an image of the web application's appearance:
